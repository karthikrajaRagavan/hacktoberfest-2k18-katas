# Hacktoberfest 2018 Code Challenges

The point of this repository is to allow anyone to start contributing on a
public repository.

## Installation

You first need to fork the repository, then go in the directory and run:

```bash
# Install the dependencies
yarn
```

## How to participate

1. Find an issue that is **not assigned**  yet
2. Implement it so that it passes both the linting and the tests (check with `yarn lint src/theFunction.js src/theNewKata.test.js` and `yarn test src/theFunction.test.js`)
3. Add a test case for a new function. You can use `yarn generate <function_name>` to create the two new files.
4. Create your **Pull Request**
5. Create an issue for your new feature

## Rules

- Each PR should contain **exactly 3 files**: your implementation, and 2 files for a new kata. All pull requests that do not follow this rule will be closed **immediately**.
- If you take too much time to complete an issue/PR, it will be closed and de-assigned from you
- Make sure your implementation passes the previous tests before opening a Pull Request.
- Do not use any npm package, it's no fun

## Files

Running `yarn generate theFunction`, would generate the two following files.

You only need to edit the **test file**, the actual implementation will be left to someone else!

**theFunction.js**:

```js
export const theFunction = () => {
  // TO IMPLEMENT IN ANOTHER PR
};
```

**theFunction.test.js**:

```js
import { theFunction } from './theFunction';

/*
 * Example of the assertions you can use for your tests:
 *
 * - Testing equality between the function's output and a constant:
 * expect(theFunction()).toEqual(123);
 *
 * - Testing that the function returns null:
 * expect(theFunction()).toBeNull();
 *
 * - Testing that the function returns a falsy value (eg. false, 0, "")
 * expect(theFunction()).toBeFalsy();
 *
 * - Testing that the function returns a truthy value (eg. true, 1, "abc")
 * expect(theFunction()).toBeTruthy();
 *
 * - Testing that the function throws
 * expect(() => { theFunction(); }).toThrow();
 */

describe('theFunction', () => {
  it('theFunction does this thing...', () => {
    // TODO Your own assertion here
  });

  it('theFunction does that other thing...', () => {
    // TODO Your own assertion here
  });

  it('theFunction does a very cool thing...', () => {
    // TODO Your own assertion here
  });
});
```
